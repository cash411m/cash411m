Such loans could also strengthen banks' reputation, since this credit would be viewed favorably by the general public, according to a recent Pew Charitable Trusts survey. Respondents overwhelmingly saw the prices that payday lenders currently charge as unfair. But 76% viewed a $500, four-month loan with a fee of $80 as fair. An even larger majority (85%) saw a $300, three-month loan with a fee of $35 as fair. These hypothetical bank loans have somewhat high APRs, but they still cost borrowers about six times less than similar installment loans from payday lenders.

Making such loans would enable banks to serve customers who do not qualify for prime products without imposing costly overdraft penalty fees, which are a primary source of bank credit for these same customers today. Small loans could also enhance access to the banking system by encouraging migration away from online payday loans and excessive use of overdraft, both of which put customers at risk of losing their checking accounts.
