The payday loan market is past due for reform. Implemented correctly, new regulatory standards will help payday loan borrowers by making these loans safer and more affordable, as well as pave the way for better, lower-cost installment loans from banks.

Consumers are eager for this change. Surveys show that most borrowers who have turned to payday lenders want reforms that will result in smaller payments and lower prices. They overwhelmingly favor stronger regulation of the market. Similarly, more than 70% of all Americans favor stronger regulation of the payday loan market and support allowing banks to offer lower-cost small loans.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took an important step toward achieving these goals in March with a proposal that would address the affordability of payday loans. With a few crucial adjustments to make it more difficult for lenders to issue financially dangerous loans and easier for them to issue safe ones, the CFPB's comprehensive and well-balanced plan should lead to smaller, more manageable payments with better outcomes for consumers.
