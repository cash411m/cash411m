The bad news is that high interest rate loans will continue to exist, since the CFPB lacks authority to limit interest rates. Payday loans with annual percentage rates of an average 400% would likely persist under a section of the proposal that requires verification of income and expenses but does not limit loan durations or payment sizes. So, for example, a $500 payday installment loan with $1,300 in fees would continue to be on the market, just as it is today.
The good news is that safer, more affordable options could thrive under rules outlined under the longer-term alternative section of the CFPB proposal. As currently devised, this alternative would require less underwriting and documentation if the lender agrees to limit loan durations to six months and cap monthly payments at an affordable 5% of monthly income, or $125 for the average borrower who earns about $30,000 per year. Payments above that amount are unaffordable for most borrowers. These two crucial safeguards would lead to much lower-cost and affordable credit than loans that merely verify income and some expenses.
